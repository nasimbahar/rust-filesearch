# Project: Accelerated File Search System for Windows Operating System

## Description
This project aims to develop an efficient file search system for the Windows operating system. Traditional search methods provided by the OS often demonstrate insufficient performance, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. In response to this, we propose the creation of our own search system, based on file system indexing and the use of a trie data structure to accelerate the search process.

## Functionality
1. **File System Indexing:** The process begins with indexing all files on the hard drive. This allows the creation of a database containing information about the location of each file and its attributes.

2. **File Search Using a Tree:** After indexing, the user can perform file searches, specifying criteria such as file name, extension, size, etc. To accelerate this process, a trie data structure is used, significantly reducing search time.

3. **Flexible Search Parameters:** The user can customize search parameters according to their needs, including filtering by file type, size, modification date, and other attributes.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** The project implementation will be done in the Rust programming language, providing high performance and safety.
- **Data Structures:** A trie will be used for indexing and searching, allowing for quick file finding.
- **Libraries:** 
    - Library to work with the file system.
    - Multithreading library to speed up the indexing process.
    - Library for creating a graphical user interface (optional).
    - ORM library for working with the database.
    - SQLite database for storing file information.

## Goals
- Increase the speed of file search in the Windows operating system.
- Create a flexible and customizable search system that meets user needs.
- Research and apply advanced methods for optimizing file system work.

## Development Plan
1. **Research:** Study existing file search methods in Windows, analyze their shortcomings and possible improvements. Study similar projects.
2. **Design:** Develop system architecture, define indexing and search methods, develop user interface.
3. **Implementation:** Write code in Rust, implement indexing, search, and user interface.
4. **Testing:** Conduct system testing on various data volumes and usage scenarios, fix bugs, and improve performance.

## Possible Improvements

1. **Adding a User Interface:** Add a graphical user interface for ease of use of the system.
2. **Expanding Functionality:** Add the ability to search by folders and other file attributes.
3. **Expanding the Search Area:** Add the ability to search for files on other devices, such as network drives and external storage.

## Conclusion
The project to develop an accelerated file search system in the Windows operating system represents an important step in improving file work performance. Implementing this system in the Rust programming language with the application of indexing and a trie will significantly speed up the search process and increase ease of use for users.

## Feed back 

__Performance Benchmarks:__ Consider including specific performance benchmarks and goals. How much faster do you aim to make file searches compared to the native Windows search? Setting clear benchmarks can help in evaluating the success of your project.

__Cross-Platform Compatibility:__ Although the project targets the Windows OS, exploring the possibility of cross-platform functionality could increase the project's applicability.
